# Logistic Regression with PyTorch

This project implements logistic regression using PyTorch to perform binary classification. It includes data generation, model training, accuracy evaluation, and decision boundary visualization.

## Features

- Synthetic dataset generation using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification`
- Logistic regression model built with `torch.nn.Sequential`
- Binary cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer
- Real-time loss tracking and accuracy reporting
- Visualization of decision boundary

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

```bash
pip install torch matplotlib scikit-learn
